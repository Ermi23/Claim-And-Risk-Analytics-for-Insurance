# Claim-And-Risk-Analytics-for-Insurance
This project focuses on analyzing historical car insurance claim data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions. The primary objective is to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk customer segments to enhance premium pricing and product offerings.

## Key Objectives:
* Data Exploration: Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights from the dataset, including trends, correlations, and potential outliers.
* Risk Assessment: Utilize statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to assess risk factors associated with different client demographics and vehicle types.
* Hypothesis Testing: Perform A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate the effectiveness of various marketing strategies and understand risk differences across regions and demographics.
* Data Version Control: Implement Data Version Control (DVC) to track changes in datasets and maintain a reproducible analysis workflow.
## Expected Outcomes:
* Detailed report on the findings from the analyses, including actionable recommendations for marketing strategies.
* Predictive models that can assist in setting optimal insurance premiums based on risk assessments.

This project aims to leverage data analytics to empower AlphaCare Insurance Solutions in making informed business decisions that cater to customer needs and improve profitability.
